# bt

## What is this?

This is a very simple sh script that allows you to connect to your trusted bluetooth devices withouth having to enter bluetoothctl

## Why?

Perhaps you're like me and don't need any type of applet to tell you which device is connected, you just want it to connect, fast.But you also don't like to have to enter bluetoothctl and do another command.

## Why not an alias?

You can launch it from dmenu or any other script launcher of your choice.

## What do I do with this?

You put it on a folder in your path.
Typically in 
```~/.local/bin```
and you run the command:
```bt```
